# The-Pig-Game üê∑
Fun 2 player game with the dice in the center üé≤ . Always this stupid random dice, right?

Easy-to-play game written in pure JS, but possibly this is not what you want to know about but more about the rules of the game.

## Rules of the game
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

## How can I play?

Oh it's simple, really, just follow [this üê∑ link](https://javpet.github.io/The-Pig-Game/), and you end up on a lovely piggy farm, where you can start the game. I enclosed a screenshot, so you don't get lost.
